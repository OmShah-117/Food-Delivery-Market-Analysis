# Food Delivery Market Analysis

##  Project Overview

This project presents an end-to-end **data integration and analysis** of a food delivery platform using data from multiple real-world sources and formats. The goal is to combine heterogeneous datasets into a single analytical view and extract meaningful business insights related to orders, users, restaurants, revenue, and customer behavior.

The analysis focuses on understanding **order trends, user behavior, restaurant performance, membership impact, and revenue seasonality**.

##  Datasets Used

The project integrates three different datasets, each representing a real-world system:

| Dataset           | Format | Description                                       |
| ----------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `orders.csv`      | CSV    | Transaction-level order data                      |
| `users.json`      | JSON   | User profile and membership details               |
| `restaurants.sql` | SQL    | Restaurant metadata including cuisine and ratings |

##  Data Integration (ETL Process)

### Step 1: Load Data

* Orders loaded from CSV
* Users loaded from JSON
* Restaurants loaded by executing SQL into a database

### Step 2: Join Logic

The datasets were merged using **LEFT JOINs** to ensure all orders are retained:

* `orders.user_id` → `users.user_id`
* `orders.restaurant_id` → `restaurants.restaurant_id`

### Step 3: Final Dataset

The final merged dataset contains:

* Order details (order ID, date, amount)
* User information (city, membership type)
* Restaurant information (name, cuisine, rating)

Output file:

```
final_food_delivery_dataset.csv
```
